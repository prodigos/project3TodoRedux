This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is a To do list project using react, react redux and react router.

The main goal here is to create a to do list that allow the user to input a todo task, and to mark it completed. Also i added an additional page name contacts that routes to the page from the navbar using react router.
